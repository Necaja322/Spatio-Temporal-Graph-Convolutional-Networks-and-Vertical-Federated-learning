# Spatio-Temporal-Graph-Convolutional-Networks-and-Vertical-Federated-learning
This repository contains a STGCN model, and a pdf produced by me explaining what it is and how it can be implemented in a wider VFL framework.
The pdf contains papers which I used and further explain the models. 
The work here was done as part of my internship at the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Institute.
