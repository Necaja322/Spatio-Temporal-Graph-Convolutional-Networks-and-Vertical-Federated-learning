# Spatio-Temporal-Graph-Convolutional-Networks-and-Vertical-Federated-learning
This repository contains a STGCN model, and a pdf produced by me explaining what it is and how it can be implemented in a wider VFL framework.
The pdf contains papers which I used and further explain the models. 
The work here was done as part of my internship at the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Institute.
Working on PeMSD7 dataset.
The main model is in the Spatial-temporal-data notebook, adequate for 1d time series data on graphs for cases such as speed predictiom while the other filles are alterations of the code inlcuiding:

-Switching to an Attention Architecture


-Fusion base final layer which combines pitputs looking st recent, hourly and daily trends


-Adding possibility for mulitple features
